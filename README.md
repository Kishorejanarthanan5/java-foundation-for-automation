# Java Foundations for Automation (Java 17 LTS)

## Overview
This repository represents a **structured Java foundation and automation-oriented practice plan**
executed over **30 days**, with an additional **12-day advanced extension**.

The goal is to build **strong, production-relevant Java skills** required for
test automation, framework development, and SDET responsibilities.

This is not academic practice. Every package and program aligns with
real automation and enterprise expectations.

---

## Background
- 6+ years experience in enterprise Manual QA
- Strong domain ownership, release validation, and RCA
- Gradual transition toward Automation / Quality Engineering
- Focus on correctness, maintainability, and clean code

---

## Java Version
- **Java 17 (LTS)**
- Coding style kept **Java 8+ compatible**, as required by most automation frameworks

---

## Repository Structure & Intent

### basics
Core Java fundamentals: variables, conditions, loops, strings, and user input.

### oops
OOP concepts critical for framework design:
inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, encapsulation,
and correct object comparison using `equals()` and `hashCode()`.

### collections
List, Set, Map usage with real automation-style use cases
such as sorting, searching, and frequency analysis.

### exceptions
Checked, unchecked, and custom exceptions with real validation scenarios.

### java8plus
Lambdas, streams, Optional, and functional-style coding
commonly used in modern automation frameworks.

### utilities
Reusable utility logic for date/time and file handling.

### enums
Enums for roles, environments, and controlled values
(used heavily in real frameworks).

### immutability
Usage of `final` and immutable class design to prevent defects.

### multithreading
Basic multithreading concepts:
thread creation, Runnable, synchronization.
(Kept intentionally light.)

### designpatterns
Core patterns used in automation:
Singleton and Factory.

### config
Simple configuration handling using properties and environment separation.

### logging
Java logging basics using `java.util.logging`
to replace `System.out.println`.

### refactoring
Examples showing how to clean, refactor, and improve existing code.

---

## Learning Approach
- 3 small, runnable programs per day
- One clear concept per class
- Daily Git commits
- No over-engineering
- No toy code

Enhancements were researched using official documentation,
community resources, and AI tools, then reviewed and refactored
for clarity and correctness.

---

## What This Repository Is NOT
- ❌ Selenium / TestNG
- ❌ Advanced concurrency
- ❌ Build tool complexity

Those are layered on top after this foundation.

---

## Intended Outcome
This repository reflects the skill level and mindset of a
**1.5 year Java + Automation engineer**
with strong manual testing experience and growing SDET depth.
